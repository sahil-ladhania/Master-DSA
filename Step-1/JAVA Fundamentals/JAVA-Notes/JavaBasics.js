1. What is JAVA ?
Answer :-
* Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
* Highly popular, object-oriented programming language.
* Platform independent programming language.
* Utilized for Android development, web development, artificial intelligence, cloud applications, and much more.

2. What is JDK ?
Answer :-
* JDK ek software development kit hai jo Java applications aur applets develop karne ke liye istemal hota hai. Ismein Java compiler, debugger, aur anya development tools shamil hote hain.
* JDK un developers ke liye upyukt hai jo Java mein applications banane ka kaam karte hain. Yeh unhe code karne aur compile karne ki suvidha deta hai.
* JDK Contains :-
    Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
    An Interpreter / Loader (Java)
    A Compiler (javac)
    An Archiver (jar) 
    etc...

3. What is JVM ?
Answer :-
* JVM ek virtual machine hai jo Java bytecode ko interpret karta hai aur usse native machine code mein translate karta hai. Ye bytecode Java compiler ke dwara generate kiya jata hai jab Java source code ko compile kiya jata hai. JVM har platform ke liye alag hota hai, lekin woh bytecode ko execute karne ka kaam karta hai.
* JVM Java applications ke liye ek crucial component hai kyunki yeh unhe cross-platform banata hai. Isse bytecode ko kisi bhi platform par run kiya ja sakta hai jo JVM ko support karta hai. Iske alawa, JVM memory management aur garbage collection jaise important features provide karta hai jo application performance ko improve karte hain.

4. What is JRE ?
Answer :-
* JRE ek environment hai jo Java applications ko run karne ki suvidha deta hai. Ismein Java Virtual Machine (JVM) aur kuchh libraries aur anya support files hote hain jo Java programs ko execute karne mein madad karte hain.
* JRE woh users ke liye hai jo sirf Java applications ko run karna chahte hain, unhe code karne ya compile karne ki zarurat nahi padti.
* Components of JRE :   
    * Deployment technologies, including deployment, Java Web Start, and Java Plug-in.
    * User interface toolkits, including Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), Swing, Java 2D, Accessibility, Image I/O, Print Service, Sound, drag, and drop (DnD), and input methods.
    * Integration libraries, including Interface Definition Language (IDL), Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Remote Method Invocation Over Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (RMI-IIOP), and scripting.
    * Other base libraries, including international support, input/output (I/O), extension mechanism, Beans, Java Management Extensions (JMX), Java Native Interface (JNI), Math, Networking, Override Mechanism, Security, Serialization, and Java for XML Processing (XML JAXP).
    * Lang and util base libraries, including lang and util, management, versioning, zip, instrument, reflection, Collections, Concurrency Utilities, Java Archive (JAR), Logging, Preferences API, Ref Objects, and Regular Expressions.
    * Java Virtual Machine (JVM), including Java HotSpot Client and Server Virtual Machines.


5. What is the Difference between JDK , JRE and JVM ?
Answer :-
JDK(JAVA Development Kit) :
    * Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program.
    * Kit(or Package) that includes two things -
        * Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs).
        * JRE (to execute your java program).
JRE(JAVA Runtime Environment) : 
    * Installation package that provides an environment to only run(not develop) the java program(or application)onto your machine.
    * Only used by those who only want to run Java programs that are end-users of your system.
JVM(JAVA Virtual Machine) :
    * Very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.
    * Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an Interpreter.

6. What is JIT ?
Answer :-
* JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler ek performance optimization technique hai jo ki Java Virtual Machine (JVM) mein istemal hota hai. Jab Java code ko compile kiya jata hai, toh pehle use bytecode mein convert kiya jata hai. Phir, JVM us bytecode ko execute karta hai. Jab bytecode execute hota hai, tab JIT compiler use hota hai. JIT compiler bytecode ko native machine code mein translate karta hai, jo ki host machine par seedhe execute kiya ja sakta hai.
* JIT compiler ka upyog karke, Java programs ki performance ko improve kiya ja sakta hai. Kyunki bytecode ko runtime mein native machine code mein translate kiya jata hai, isse execution speed badhti hai. Yeh technique memory ka bhi better use karta hai, kyunki sirf woh parts translate kiye jate hain jo ki program ke execution ke samay zarurat padti hain. Overall, JIT compiler Java applications ko fast aur efficient banata hai.
