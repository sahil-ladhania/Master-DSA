1. What is while Loop in JAVA ?
Answer :-
* The "while" loop in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

2. What is do-while Loop in JAVA ?
Answer :-
* The "do-while" loop in Java is similar to the "while" loop, but the condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop body. 
* This means that the loop body is executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

3. What is for Loop in JAVA ?
Answer :-
* The "for" loop in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to iterate over a range of values or perform a repetitive task a fixed number of times.

4. What is for-each Loop in JAVA ?
Answer :-
* The "for-each" loop in Java is a special type of loop that is used to iterate over elements in an array or a collection. 
* It simplifies the process of iterating over elements and is particularly useful when you don't need to know the index of the current element.

5. Which Loop to use When ?
Answer :-
* Use a "while" loop when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition that may change during execution.
* Use a "do-while" loop when you want to ensure that the loop body is executed at least once, regardless of the condition.
* Use a "for" loop when you want to iterate over a range of values or perform a repetitive task a fixed number of times.
* Use a "for-each" loop when you want to iterate over elements in an array or a collection without needing to know the index of the current element.

6. What are Pitfalls of Loops ?
Answer :-
* Common pitfalls of loops include infinite loops, where the loop condition never becomes false, leading to the program getting stuck in an endless loop.
* Another pitfall is off-by-one errors, where the loop iterates one too many or one too few times, leading to incorrect results or runtime errors.
* Additionally, loops can sometimes result in code that is difficult to read and understand, especially if the loop body is complex or contains nested loops.
